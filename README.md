# Description

For challenge 3, it was my job to add the javascript logic to existing starter html and css to finish a random password generator. The generator takes in user choices and produces a random password based on their selections. The link to the deployed page is: https://sevepalattao.github.io/Challenge3-SeveP/

# Screenshot

Below is a screenshot of my deployed page and an example generated password.
